# JS Music APP (AWIP)
![superLint](https://github.com/cjvillar/js_music_electron/actions/workflows/super-linter.yml/badge.svg)
### Uses JS package: https://tonejs.github.io/ with Electron. 

#### Notes:
#### To import Tone.js: import * as Tone from 'tone'
#### Run in terminal with 'npm run start'
#### Currently depends on importing https://unpkg.com/tone@14.7.77/build/Tone.js

#### The first version is always rough, right?
