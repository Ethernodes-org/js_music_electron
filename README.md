![upTime - TEST](https://github.com/cjvillar/js_music_electron/actions/workflows/Uptime.yml/badge.svg) <-- Testing

Uses JS package: <https://tonejs.github.io/> with Electron 

### Notes:
- To import Tone.js: import * as Tone from 'tone'
- Run in terminal with 'npm run start'
- Currently depends on importing <https://unpkg.com/tone@14.7.77/build/Tone.js>

The first version is always rough, right?
